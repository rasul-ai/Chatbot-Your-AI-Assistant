This repository is created to learn Streamlit(a open-source python library) that allows to create interactive web applications for machine learning, data visualization, and data analysis. Here I am implementing OpenAI model to create a ChatGPT like architecture using Streamlit.

Here is a short description how I manage the steps to create a ChatGPT like structure,

    1. First, I have Built a bot that mirrors my input to get a feel just like a simple chatbot and how it work.
       
    2. Then I have applied a simple GUI with streaming.
       
    3. Finally, I have used pretrained gpt-3 model to respond to the user input and successfully built a ChatGPT-like app.
To complete these steps, [This site](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/llms/build-conversational-apps) helps me a lot.\
To run the python code use the following,
```
streamlit run [file path]
```
\
To install dependencies write the below script in commandline,
```
pip install openai streamlit
```
